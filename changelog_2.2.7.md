## PowerShell Enhancements âœ¨

We have worked hard to improve your PowerShell experience with a new set of ProFile commands that give your systemh better functionality and response time. We've also added a host system that runs in the background to track resource and battery usage. We've also added simple and effective commands like: `<kbd>`I `CD...</kbd> - Which goes to the root directory, <kbd>cdir</kbd> - goes into a directory, clears the screen and then displays the contents of the directory.`
