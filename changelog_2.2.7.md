## Codeium Command Enhancements âœ¨

We have worked hard to improve your Codeium Command experience, with better models and more context-awareness. We've also gotten rid of the pesky +/- signs on the diffs generated by Codeium Command. Generate new code or edit existing code with `<kbd>`âŒ˜`</kbd>` `<kbd>`I `</kbd>` on MacOS and `<kbd>`Ctrl `</kbd>` `<kbd>`I `</kbd>` on Windows and Linux.

## Introducing Smart Paste ðŸ§ 

Say hello to Smart Paste, your new best friend for seamless coding. Whether you're copying snippets from your browser, migrating codebases, or just wanting to translate some code, Smart Paste automatically converts it to match the language of your active file. To use it you just need to have some code in your clipboard then press `<kbd>`âŒ˜`</kbd>` `<kbd>`^`</kbd>` `<kbd>`V `</kbd>`  on MacOS and `<kbd>`Ctrl `</kbd>` `<kbd>`Alt `</kbd>` `<kbd>`V `</kbd>` on Windows and Linux. Effortlessly integrate and translate code like never before!

We get itâ€”sometimes you just want to fly solo without autocomplete chiming in. That's why we've added a snooze feature, giving you the freedom to code without suggestions whenever you need full control.
