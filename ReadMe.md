# ProFile ReadMe File

## A quickly growing  

This log was originaly for changes made to the ProFile project. Everything that was changed should be recorded in here one way or another. Then I realized that this project didn't have a ReadMe.md so I converted the _ChangeLog_ as it was the closest thing at the time.

## Updated Functions

Our latest __updates__ supercharges your terminal experience with better commands allowing for quicker response time and much more control over your system.

It also checks what computer that you are using and builds multiple reports and if the system is running off the new portable mode it copies these documents and won't run it again at startup making it much more efficient.

### What We Are Working On

* [ ] - Developing of a GUI 
* [ ] - Splitting functions into more managable scripts _(as the project gets larger I find that it is getting harder to keep track of.)_
* [ ] - Standalone Installer
* [ ] - Exciting features that are going to make ProFile for everyone.
  * [X] - Message and file encryption / decryption (Part 2)
  * [ ] - Text to speech.

## PowerShell Enhancements âœ¨

We have worked hard to improve your PowerShell experience with a new set of ProFile commands that give your systemh better functionality and response time. We've also added a host system that runs in the background to track resource and battery usage. We've also added simple and effective commands like: `<kbd>`I `CD...</kbd> - Which goes to the root directory, <kbd>cdir</kbd> - goes into a directory, clears the screen and then displays the contents of the directory.`

Whether you're copying snippets from your browser, migrating codebases, or just wanting to translate some code, Smart Paste automatically converts it to match the language of your active file. To use it you just need to have some code in your clipboard then press `<kbd>`âŒ˜`</kbd>` `<kbd>`^`</kbd>` `<kbd>`V `</kbd>` on MacOS and `<kbd>`Ctrl `</kbd>` `<kbd>`Alt `</kbd>` `<kbd>`V `</kbd>` on Windows and Linux.
